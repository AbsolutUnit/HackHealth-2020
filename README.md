# HackHealth-2020
This is a project created in Stony Brook University's HackHEALTH Hackathon
by Aneek Barua, George Liang, Philip Liu, Jacky Chen, and Yupeng.

It's a simple mobile application that utilizes Tensorflow to identify
food and assign it to a webserver that outputs the amount of calories it has.
Unfortunately, it is unimplemented and still in pieces.
